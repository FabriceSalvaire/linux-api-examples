# Read and Decode /dev/input/event<NUMBER>

## Introduction

The X86 architecture implements protection rings to separate the
kernel and user space.  It means there is a bridge to cross between
the kernel and user space.  For this reason, the Linux kernel
implements two mechanismes (*) to communicate with the user space.

(*) We simplify the reality in this introduction.

The first one, use the X86_64 `syscall` instruction to perform a
system call.  By simplicity, the Linux kernel can only implement a
limited list of core functions.  Because it would not make no sense to
implement an OO API with zillion of methods wrapped by system calls.
Actually, the kernel implements roughly 400 system calls (see
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl).
However the Microsoft Windows OS has something like 5 times more
system calls due to its monolitic design.  It means Windows has system
calls to manage mouse for example.

The second one, is to use several memory buffers through a virtual
file system (VFS).  It explains why the Linux kernel exports events
from input devices to the user space using the
`/dev/input/event<NUMBER>` devices files.  Basically, the kernel
manages device hot plug and translate a data flow from a bus like USB
to a buffer, where the events are queued and serialised to this simple
binary structure:

```
struct input_event {
    uint64_t sec;
    uint64_t usec;
    uint16_t type;
    uint16_t code;
    int32_t value;
}
```

libevdev is a library for handling evdev kernel devices. It abstracts the evdev ioctls through type-safe interfaces and provides functions to change the appearance of the device

libudev is part of systemd https://github.com/systemd/systemd https://systemd.io http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd

kernel → libevdev → libinput → Compositor → Wayland client

In the Linux kernel’s input system, there are two pieces: the device
driver and the event driver. The device driver talks to the hardware,
obviously. Today, for most USB devices this is handled by the usbhid
driver. The event drivers handle how to expose the events generated by
the device driver to userspace. Today this is primarily done through
evdev, which creates character devices (typically named
/dev/input/eventN) and communicates with them through struct
input_event messages. See include/linux/input.h for its definition.

When a device is connected, the kernel creates an entry in sysfs for
it and generates a hotplug event. That hotplug event is processed by
udev, which applies some policy, attaches additional properties to the
device, and ultimately creates a device node for you somewhere in
/dev.

## How to use the program

List USB devices, using the command in a terminal:
```
lsusb
```

List the devices to discover your system:
```
ls -l /dev/input/*
```

Watch kernel events when you unplug/plug devices:
```
dmesg
```

Run the program, notice it requires superuser right to read the device file:
```
sudo ./read-event <MOUSE_EVENT_NUMBER>
# Hit Ctrl+C to exit
```
